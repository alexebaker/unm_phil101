UNM PHIL 101 - Introduction to Philosophy


The ancient philosopher Aristotle once said that philosophy begins in wonder. While many disciplines are aimed at answering questions of interest mostly only for researchers in their fields, philosophy seeks to answer the big questions that in many ways define the human condition. What can we know and what can we not know? What are these things called minds, and how can I know that other people have them? What, if anything, is moral and immoral? Does God exist? Is there free will? What is the good life?
               
In this course, students will be introduced to some attempts by philosophers throughout history to answer these questions and others. The course will emphasize development of critical thinking skills, reading comprehension through close examination of complicated texts, and clear, thoughtful argumentative writing.
